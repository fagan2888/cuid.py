# cuid.py

Implementation of https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid in Python.

A `cuid` is a portable, and sequentially-ordered unique identifier designed for horizontal scalability and speed -- this version is ported from the reference implementation in Javascript.

Tested on CPython 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 as well as PyPy.
